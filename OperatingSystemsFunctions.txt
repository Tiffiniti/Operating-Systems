Operating systems have many functions, and the first one I'll be talking about is providing a user interface. A user interface (UI) determines how the person using a computer interacts with the operating system by establishing how input is entered and how data is formatted on the monitor. Most of us are familiar with graphical user interfaces (GUI) but another type that exists is a command-line interface. GUIs generally have images like icons, buttons, windows, etc. for us to interact with, while command-line interfaces use keywords and abbreviations to issue commands. We often use a command-line interface for network troubleshooting, device configuration, and more.
Operating systems also manage all of the programs on the device. Single tasking operating systems are less common than the multitasking operating systems that most present computers use. In a multitasking operating system you can run more than one application at once and toggle between active and background programs efficiently.
