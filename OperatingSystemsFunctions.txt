Operating systems have many functions, and the first one I'll be talking about is providing a user interface. A user interface (UI) determines how the person using a computer interacts with the operating system by establishing how input is entered and how data is formatted on the monitor. Most of us are familiar with graphical user interfaces (GUI) but another type that exists is a command-line interface. GUIs generally have images like icons, buttons, windows, etc. for us to interact with, while command-line interfaces use keywords and abbreviations to issue commands. We often use a command-line interface for network troubleshooting, device configuration, and more.
